/*
Explanation of Improvements in releaseStorage.lua:

1. **Validation of Player Object**: The `releaseStorage` function now includes a check to ensure that the player object is valid before attempting to set the storage value. This prevents potential errors that could occur if the player object is not valid.

2. **Passing Player ID in addEvent**: In the `onLogout` function, the player ID is passed to the `addEvent` function instead of the player object. This ensures that the player object is retrieved fresh when the event is executed, avoiding issues that may arise if the player object is not valid at the time of the event.

3. **Utility of Storage Value**: The `onLogout` function includes a comment explaining the utility of the storage value. It suggests that the storage value can be used to assign a unique ID record to the storage, which can then be used by other functions (such as quest/SQM/refresh) as a conditional recognition of the player. This ensures that the ID registered in the storage is unique and its validation is consistent.

4. **Example Usage**: An example usage is provided in the comments of the `onLogout` function. It shows how to proceed with a script configuration if the player's storage value matches their ID. This serves as a guide for developers on how to utilize the storage value effectively in their scripts.
