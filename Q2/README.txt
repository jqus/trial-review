/*
Explanation of Improvements in printSmallGuildNames.lua:

1. **Proper Result Set Handling**: The revised function now correctly iterates through all the guild names in the result set, ensuring that all relevant guild names are processed and sent to the player.

2. **Failure Handling**: The function now includes a check for when no results are found, providing appropriate feedback to the player instead of failing silently.

3. **User Feedback**: Instead of using print statements, the function now uses `player:sendTextMessage(MESSAGE_EVENT_ADVANCE, "")` to send messages directly to the player, improving the user experience by providing immediate and clear feedback.

4. **Resource Management**: The function ensures that the result set is properly freed after use, preventing potential memory leaks.
