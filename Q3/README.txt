/*
Key Utilities and Improvements:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: The function robustly checks for the existence of both the player and the member intended for removal. If either does not exist, it provides clear feedback to the user, preventing confusion and potential errors that could arise from trying to remove non-existent party members.

2. **Improved Code Readability**: The function is structured with a clear separation of concerns, which simplifies understanding and maintaining the code. Each step of the process is logically separated and handled distinctly, making the function easier to debug and modify.

3. **Direct User Feedback**: It sends messages directly to the player regarding the status of their request to remove a member. This immediate feedback enhances the user experience by keeping players informed about the actions taking place, which is particularly useful in a dynamic game environment where party composition can significantly impact gameplay.
